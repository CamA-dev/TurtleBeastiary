This Addon is inspired by [classicbestiary](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicbestiary)
I try my best to implement all features to the Turtle WoW version. 
The limited api are the biggest problem.
It's my first addon and first Lua Project... So there is much to learn :)



## Install- Manuell

1. Download and extract [latest version](https://github.com/CamA-dev/TurtleBeastiary/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
1. Download and extract the Addon GetSpellInfoVanilla [latest version](https://github.com/Schaka/GetSpellInfoVanilla/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Copy the "TurtleBeastiary-main" folder to `<WoW>/Interface/AddOns` and rename it to "TurtleBeastiary"
2. Copy the "GetSpellInfoVanilla-main" folder to `<WoW>/Interface/AddOns` and rename it to "GetSpellInfoVanilla"
3. (Re)start WoW
